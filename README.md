calculator project for TOP

Description:
This is the final project of the fundamentals page for The 
Odin Project. This simple calculator performs simple calculations
of the 4 operators and handles float values.

Tech Stack:
As this was for the fundamentals, I only used html, JS, and
CSS.

What I've learned:
This project really put all that I've learned so far into
web development to the test. Before this, I did not have much
background in front-end development and it took me a while to
understand everything learned in CSS since the JS was already
stuff I understood before this.

Things to improve on:
For this calculator I would like to add some features in the future:
- exponent math
- calculation history
- moving previous calculations up
- adding hovering feature
- adding sounds
- implementing keyboard to work on calculator
